OpenGL SuperBible Fourth Edition
================================

These are examples from The OpenGL SuperBible Fourth Edition that I've re-written
in SFML. The functionality _should_ be rather close to the original examples.
All projects have CMakeLists.txt files, which I open in QtCreator. You can also
just make a build directory and issue a cmake followed by make, e.g.  
`mkdir build`  		
`cd build`  		
`cmake ../Triangle`  	
`make`  		
`cd ../Triangle/bin`  	
`./Triangle`		
All projects have their own README.md files as well.		
As for the license, I've included the GPLv3 license, but the book's authors are
the ones to consult if you're curious about using this code in another project

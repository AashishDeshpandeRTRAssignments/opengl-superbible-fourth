OpenGL SuperBible Fourth Edition
================================

These are examples from The OpenGL SuperBible Fourth Edition that I've written
in SFML. The functionality _should_ be rather close to the original examples.
All projects have CMakeLists.txt files, which I open in QtCreator. You can also
just make a build directory and issue a cmake followed by make, e.g.  
`mkdir build`  
`cd build`  
`cmake ../Triangle`  
`make`  
`cd ../Triangle/bin`  
`./Triangle`
All projects have their own README.md files as well.
